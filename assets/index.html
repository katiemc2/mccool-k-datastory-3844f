      <h1> Katie's Data Story </h1>
      <p>
        In both my Data Visualization and my Explained Video, I analyzed two different companies, Facebook and Uber, through an ethical lense. Ethics has been a running theme throughout my work in this class, as I have explored how both Facebook and Uber's actions have affected their user's privacy.

        <h2>Data Collection & Visualization</h2>
        <p>
          In my Data Collection and my Data Visualization, I explored the "creep factor" of Facebook's suggested articles. I rated how pertinent the suggested Facebook article was to my life on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being the least creepy and 5 being the most creepy. For example, one suggested ad was about Lincoln cars. I rated this to be a "4" because my first car was a Lincoln Aviator. I took into account whether a friend shared the article or if it was randomly generated, as well as the time, date and a brief description of the article. I then translated this data into a visualization. My Data Visualization divided my data up into four quadrants. On the y-axis, the data is separated by Facebook source, whether it was randomly generated by Facebook itself or if it was shared by a friend. On the x-axis, the data is further separated by the genre of the source, pop culture or news. Each piece of data is represented by a dot. There are five different colors ranging from light purple to dark purple. The lighter the color, the less "creepy" the piece of data.

        <h3>Explained Video</h3>
        <p> My Explained Video explores the ethics of Uber and their new patent that aims to combat the problem between Uber drivers and their intoxicated passengers. The app tracks various types of data such as the walking speed and location of the potential passenger, and gives drivers the options to deny passengers a ride if the driver deems them to be intoxicated. This is unethical because this information could be made public and passenger's potential employers could gain access to this information, which in turn could affect the passengers chances of getting a job. Furthermore, it invades passengers' privacy by gathering private data from their phone through the app. Additionally, the ability for drivers to deny rides could pose as a danger to potential passengers. This could cause them to seek other, more dangerous, avenues home such as drunk driving or walking home alone late at night. </p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p> Ultimately, I learned a lot about ethics through this class and broadened my understanding of how a company's ethics can effect their customers and their privacy. This class has been a great experience that has pushed my boundaries to places I never thought I would be able to go.
